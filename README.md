As the energy sector races toward radical climate action, scaling new solutions is essential. Automated control has been crucial to efficient operations, and detecting unforeseen critical shifts can be a game-changer for safety.

This repository presents a novel approach to change-point detection (CPD) that leverages Online Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (ODMDwC). Designed specifically for complex industrial systems where timely detection of behavioral shifts is critical, this method captures both spatial and temporal system patterns and adapts dynamically to non-linear system changes due to factors like aging and seasonality.

Our ODMDwC-based method addresses real-world challenges of non-uniform data streams in safety-critical systems by providing reliable CPD without dependency on exhaustive physical models. It leverages control input to enhance change detection performance, yielding robust and intuitive results even in environments with high noise.

## üöÄ Features

- **Adaptive Linearization**: ODMDwC dynamically adapts to system behavior, maintaining a correspondence between detected changes and their actual extent.
- **Truncated ODMDwC with Time-Delay Embeddings**: Incorporates higher-order time-delay embeddings to improve noise robustness and capture broadband features.
- **Enhanced CPD Performance**: The method outperforms SVD-based and other common CPD methods on benchmark datasets, improving detection accuracy while reducing false positives.
- **Intuitive Hyperparameter Tuning**: Offers practical guidelines for hyperparameter selection to streamline model application.

## Benchmark Evaluation

## üõ† For Developers

### Installation (for Local Use)

This project depends on Rust for some dependencies. If you have Rust installed and available in your PATH, you can use `uv` for fast dependency management. Otherwise, use the Docker approach for a containerized environment.

#### Option 1: Local Installation with uv (requires Rust)

If you have Rust installed, congratulations! You can use `uv` for faster dependency management:

```sh
uv sync
```

#### Option 2: Devcontainer (requires VSCode)

If you have VSCode installed, you can use the devcontainer feature to create a containerized environment. Just open the project in VSCode and click on the `Reopen in Container` button.

#### Option 3: Docker (recommended if Rust is not available)

If you don't have Rust installed, the Docker approach is the way to go:

```sh
docker build -t odmd-subid-cpd .
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v .:/app odmd-subid-cpd
```
